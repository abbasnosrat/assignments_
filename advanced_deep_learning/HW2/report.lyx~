\begin_layout Section
Generative Adversarial Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stage 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The loss function used in cyclegan is consisted of three parts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Adversarial Loss
\series default
: This loss is formulated as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{L_{GAN}}=\mathbb{E}_{y\sim P_{data}(y)}\left[\left(D(y)-1\right)^{2}\right]+\mathbb{E}_{X\sim P_{data}(X)}\left[\left(D(G(X))\right)^{2}\right]
\]

\end_inset

This loss is applied to the output of the discriminator and it is basically
 a classification loss which gives a hard 1 label to the real images and
 a hard zero label to the generated images which tries to train the discriminato
r to distinguish between fake and real images.
 Optimizing this loss for the generator, trains the generator to generate
 images that will increase the discriminator loss .This loss is responsible
 for the adversarial nature of cyclegan and without this loss, the generators
 and discriminators cannot be trained.
 There are two 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L_{GAN}}$
\end_inset

 terms corresponding to the two pairs of generator and discriminators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cycle Consistency Loss:
\series default
 This loss is and L1 loss between the input image and the output of the
 second generator.
 It tries to learn the networks to return the image to its original state
 after passing it through both generators.
 In other words 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{2}(G_{1}(X))\approx X\Rightarrow\mathcal{L}_{cycle}=\left\Vert X-G_{2}(G_{1}(X))\right\Vert 
\]

\end_inset

The general idea of GANs is that the network can learn any mapping from
 the input domain to the target domain.
 However, the network may learn to change the spatial properties of the
 image such that the output image looks nothing like the input image.
 In order to prevent such phenomena, cycle consistency loss is utilized.
 Utilization of this loss, enforces the network to only apply the minimum
 change required to go from the input domain to the target domain.
 By removing this term from the objective function, the network may learn
 to change the image too much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Identity Loss:
\series default
 This loss ensures that if an image from the target domain is given as input
 to the generator, the image remains unchanged.
 This loss has no positive effect on training of the networks and in some
 cases it is better to be removed.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The authors of cycleGAN used MSE loss instead of cross entropy due to training
 stability.
 Optimizing MSE loss is more stable than BCE and would result in generation
 of better quality images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If an objective is consisted of multiple terms, it is generally represented
 as a weighted sum.
 By increasing the weight for the the more important terms and/or decreasing
 for the less important ones, one can ensure better training and fulfillment
 of the desired objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Yes.
 The generator uses a hierarchical architecture.
 It reduces dimensions at first and then increases them to match the target
 image.
 Any CNN architecture following the same pattern can be used.
 A good example of this type of networks can be UNET.
 For the discriminator part, any classifier architecture can be used since
 it is a classification problem.
 However, the results may be worse than PatchGan.
 Another approach can be the use of Siamese networks.
 The objective can be reformulated.
 In the new formulation, Instead of classification loss for the discriminator,
 Triplet loss or Contrastive loss can be used.
 By changing the loss in this way, the discriminator tries to create distance
 between real and fake images and the generator tries to get its images
 among the real images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stage 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The model has been trained for 20 epochs due to lack of computational power
 and time.
 The identity loss was removed to reduce computations and save time.
 The results are demonstrated in figure 1:

As witnessed in Figure 1, the adversarial loss is increasing but all other
 losses are decreasing.
 The increase in adversarial loss can have two possible causes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The Generator may be too powerful compared to discriminator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It may be due to the stochastic nature of training and further training
 may remedy this problem.

 to zebras than vice versa.
 This can be fixed with further training.

\begin_layout Section
Variational Auto Encoder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stage 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if the decoder is sufficiently powerful, then the training objective can
 be solved with a dumb strategy: the encoder always produces 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z)$
\end_inset

 regardless of the data, and the decoder always produces 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 regardless of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The paper Neural Discrete Representation Learning (from van den Oord and
 others from deepmind) calls this "posterior collapse".
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Due to posterior collapse, VAEs cannot be controled since the decoder ignores
 the latent space.
 This results in the VAE only producing a limited set of outputs and not
 being able to generalize
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In a GAN models, the generator may be able to learn one or a few pluseble
 outputs which can decive the discriminator.
 However this is not desirable.
 This phenomena can be remedied if the discriminator learns to distinguish
 between real and fake inputs.
 However if the discriminator gets stuck in a local minimum, it will not
 be able to solve the loophole that the generator has discoverd and thus
 resulting in the GAN only generating a few different output images.
 This phenomena is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mode collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The difference between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

posterior collapse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that the former is cauesed due to under parameterized discriminator
 but the latter is caused by over parameterized decoder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stage 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The VQ-VAE loss is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=log(p(x|z_{q}(x))+\left\Vert sg\left[z_{e}(x)\right]-e\right\Vert _{2}^{2}+\beta\left\Vert z_{e}(x)-sg[e]\right\Vert _{2}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

The first term is the reconstruction loss which basically can be simplified
 to an L2 loss between the input and the output assuming a Gaussian data
 likelihood.
 This term is responsible for training the encoder and the decoder(it is
 the auto encoder loss) and by removing this term the encoder and the decoder
 cannot be trained.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The second term is pushing the code-book vectors to their corresponding
 encoded vectors.
 SG is an abbreviation for stop gradient which means detaching the argument
 from the computational graph.
 The embeddings optimize this term hence by removing this part, training
 of the embeddings is disrupted.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The last term pushes the encoded vectors to the code-book vectors(the conjugate
 operation of the second term somehow).
 This term is a part of training loss for the encoder and removing it will
 negatively effect the training of the encoder part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Auto-Regressive models work by feeding their regression output back to model
 for the next prediction.
 First, the VQ-VAE is trained end to end to learn how to reconstruct the
 images.
 Once the training is done, the model has a fully trained encoder, decoder
 and code-book vector set.
 After the training, to generate novel images, a special token is passed
 to the predictor part and the predictor generates a number.
 The generated number is then fed back to the predictor.
 This operation is repeated until the latent space which is 32 by 32 in
 this case is filled with numbers.
 The model generates new images based on the generated 32 by 32 matrix and
 the code-book vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The prior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z)$
\end_inset

 is a uniform distribution and the posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z|x)$
\end_inset

 is a single vector.
 This is due to discretization of the posterior with the code-book vectors.
 If KL divergence between the prior and the posterior is computed, the result
 would be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1\times\log\left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{k}}\right)=\log(k)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the length of the prior distribution.

\end_inset

 It can be seen that both reconstruction loss and VQ loss are decreasing
 and the perplexity, which is the utilization rate of the code-book vectors,
 is increasing.
 after 40 epochs everything will converge.
 Hence, 40 epochs was enough training.
 A UMAP abstraction of the embedding vectors is illustrated in Figure 4:
