Training DistilBERT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The model was trained with a notebook provided by Huggingface website.
 The notebook used the pretrained Bert tokenizer to tokenize the sentences
 and provide attention masks.
 This tokenizer took the sentence, maximum length and the option to use
 padding for each sentence.
 After tokenazation, the Bert model took the tokenized sentences and their
 attention mask as input and generated p-values for each word in the sentence.
 The model has been trained for 5 epochs with crossentropy loss and matthews
 correlation as metric.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a plethora of text augmentation techniques.
 These techniques can be divided into three levels.
 The lowest level is word level.
 Techniques in word level involve changing random letters in randomly selected
 words in a text.
 The second level is sentence level.
 In this level, words in a sentence can be omitted, substituted with their
 synonym or antonym or the word order can be scrambled.
 The third level is text level or paragraph level.
 One of the techniques in this level is re-translation.
 This technique, utilizes a translation engine to translate the text to
 another language and translate it back to the parent language.
 There are a few repercussions that must be taken for using some of these
 methods.
 For example, using antonym substitution, would result in changing the context
 of the sentence and would turn a positive sentence into a negative sentence.
 The label must also be changed should this context change occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The code could not evaluate accuracy so instead, matthews correlation is
 reported.
 Training metric is

\begin_layout Section
Using SHAP and LIME
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The following is a brief explanation of SHAP and LIME:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
SHAP comes from game theory.
 Basically, SHAP computes the level of contribution of each feature for
 the given prize.
 In context of classification, the prize is the decision made by the model.
 To evaluate the level of contribution (also known as Shaply values), the
 algorithm evaluates shaply values for a feature in all possible subsets
 of features involving that feature.
 As an example, lets choose a subset of three features.
 all features aside the three chosen features are replaced with random values.
 This substitution is due to the fact that random values have no prediction
 power.
 Assuming the three selected features are called A,B and C and we would
 like to evaluate Shaply value of feature A.
 First model predicts with A, B and C and then A is replaced with a random
 value and the model runs again.
 Using the p-values provided from both experiments, SHAP evaluates Shaply
 value of feature A.
 Shap is repeated for all feature sets involving A and then the total Shaply
 value for A is an average of shaply values for all subsets.
 A great limitation of SHAP, is its computational complexity which is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{n}$
\end_inset

 where n is the number of features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LIME stands for Local Interpretatble Model-Agnostic Explanation.
 As the name suggests, This algorithm fits a locally linear model at the
 decision boundary which is explainable and uses the linear model to provide
 contribution of each feature based on p-values provided by the linear model.
 The problem with LIME is that although the explanations may make sense
 locally, they may not be sensible globally.
 One advantage of LIME over SHAP is the lower computational cost.

It can be interpreted the model has learned grammar from its attention to
 words and expressions such as 
\series bold
to, es 
\series default
or pronouns and verbs placement.
 For example, in Figure 2, the contribution of the expression 
\series bold
es
\series default
 made to classifying the sentence as incorrect is higher than other words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fairness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The model associates certain jobs based on gender with a high bias which
 quit sexist and unfair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Performing sentence level text augmentations such as replacing every male
 name or pronoun with a female, could remedy the problem.
 If the model learns that a man can work as a nurse or a woman as a carpenter
 for example, it would no longer associate those jobs with a certain gender.
 However, statistically speaking, some jobs are indeed more associated with
 certain genders and the aforementioned augmentation would reduce model
 power.
 For example, the number of women working as carpenters is insignificant
 and this fact is reflected in the dataset.
 The model can exploit this fact to preform with more accuracy.
 All in all, such augmentations must not be preformed with a heavy hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some metrics used to quantify model fairness include:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Disparate Impact
\series default
: This is the ratio of probability of favorable outcomes between the unprivilege
d and privileged groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Average odds difference
\series default
: This is the average of difference in false positive rates and true positive
 rates between unprivileged and privileged groups.
 A value of 0 implies both groups have equal benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Average odds difference
\series default
: This is the average of difference in false positive rates and true positive
 rates between unprivileged and privileged groups.
 A value of 0 implies both groups have equal benefit.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Using such metrics along with a statistical analysis of the dataset regarding
 the distribution of minority groups and awareness of the model towards
 the unprivileged groups would provide a good understanding of model fairness.

 From the figure above, it can be inferred that the attack pushes the images
 towards automobile class more than others.
 (Attacks were preformed with torchattack library)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are three main methods of defense against this attack.
 Data augmentation with adversarial examples, Attack detection with PCA
 and loss modification.
 Due to ease of implementation, the first method was chosen.
 For each batch, random samples were chosen and tainted with attack and
 the model trained as normal with the modified data.

As demonstrated above, the gradients have more clarity than their previous
 visualization.
 This means that the model has trained to pay more attention to the gradients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The defense method was chosen for its ease of implementation.
 However, the newly added perturbation made training more difficult and
 unstable for the model.
 with incomplete training, it can be claimed that this method has success
 to some degree.

The image was attached to the computational graph, fed to the model, the
 model gradients were set to zero and the gradients were evaluated with
 respect to images compered to labels.
 The gradients were converted to gray-scale and visualized with a heatmap.
 This method was the easiest to use hence it was chosen.
